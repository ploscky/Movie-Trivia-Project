## Project Description

### Motivation
The development of a movie trivia project is compelling because of the opportunity to learn how to connect a database to a working program. This project also appeals to our personal interests and hobbies in film and media; we want to develop something that will have those interests intersect with programming.

### Languages, Tools, and Technologies
The project will primarily use Python for programming the game. We will use SQL for database management and a csv file for the movie data set. Beyond that, GitHub and Visual Studio Code will be used to create this program.
